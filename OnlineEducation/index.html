        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or preceptor after 
        initiation.[34] The education was delivered through Gurukula. The relationship between the Guru and his Shishya (students
        /disciples) was a very important part of education.[35] Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) is one of the example of 
        ancient higher learning institute in India from possibly 8th century BCE, however, it is debatable whether it could be 
        regarded a university or not in modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of 
        particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a 
        Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Education is the key to success</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Up until 1976, under the Indian constitution, school education was a state subject; 
        states possessed full jurisdiction over making and implementing education policies. After the 42nd Amendment of the 
        Constitution of India was passed in 1976, education fell under the concurrent list.[8] This allowed the central 
        government to recommend education policies and programmes, even if state governments continued to wield extensive 
        autonomy in implementing these programmes.[8] In a country as large as India, now with 28 states and eight union 
        territories, this has created vast differences between states in terms of their policies, plans, programmes and 
        initiatives relating to school education. Periodically, national policy frameworks are created to guide states in their 
        creation of state-level programs and policies. </p>
